I came to Shenzhen by chance this August. I have never imagined that Shenzhen would be my city.

<p class="text-black-50 text-center font-italic">Train from Guangzhou to Shenzhen</p>

The first thing I want to talk about is the traffic. I am not going to talk about the traffic jam but the traffic safety instead. The house I am living now is not far away from my company so I walk back home after work almost every day. One of the things I dislike about the surrounding is the traffic safety. On the way back home, I usually encounter a couple of crossroads. It is really a disorder in the crossroads traffic and I am shocked. The biker in Futian district don't get off their bikes when going through the crossroads, making a lot of danger to the walkers. As a result, I feel forced to be aware so that I cannot feel the freedom of walking. I have forgotten what the situations are in other districts like Luohu or Nanshan. Are they the same?

The second is about my social activities. Participating English Corner is one of them. @joe introduced me to it in the workfloor. I was excited the moment when I heard about it because I have not been attending an activity of that kind for a long time and I have passion about English indeed. A few days later, I attended the English Corner for the first time. Now participating it become one of my habit.

When I shared the English Corner photos with my aunt living in Sanfracisco, she suggested me attend all the activities hosted by the English Corner. She expects me to make more friends and be more open.

I would like to share more stories in Shenzhen and I hope you enjoy reading ðŸ˜Š.
